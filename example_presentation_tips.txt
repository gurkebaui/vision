### Slide 4: Limitations of Traditional Input
---
## Why We Need Better Interaction Methods

### Physical Constraints:
- ❌ Requires physical contact
- ❌ Limited range of motion
- ❌ Fatigue during extended use
- ❌ Not accessible for everyone

### Contextual Limitations:
- ❌ Noisy environments affect voice control
- ❌ Dirty/gloved hands limit touch input
- ❌ Line-of-sight required for remote controls
- ❌ Complex gestures have steep learning curves
